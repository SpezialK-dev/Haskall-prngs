# PNRG

In this projekt I will write different random number generators and test all of these in different ways

## what I will be doing
For most of this I will implement the ones mentiont in https://www.math.arizona.edu/~tgk/mc/book_chap3.pdf but I might also implement the one mentiont in https://crypto.stanford.edu/pbc/notes/crypto/prng.html. But we will see how this tourns out. Since I want to mostly use this as a learning exercise for haskall.
